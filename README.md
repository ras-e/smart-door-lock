# Semesterproject 8: Smart Door Lock

This project is on the 8th semester - on SDU Software Engineerieng Master 2024 - as part of the semesterproject.
- Combination of the Software Technology of Internet of Things course
- System Analysis & Verification

The case has the following predefined case description, however the project development has extended the requirements.

> Short Description: Design and implementation of a smart door lock with a high level of trustworthiness.

> Long Description:
> Your job is to make a prototype of a smart door lock. That is, a door lock for a front door that can be operated from a cellphone. And because it guarding houses, it needs to be > trustworthy.

> Base requirements:
> An "open door command" can be sent from a cellphone.
> Such a command should either open the door within 10s or not open the door at all.
> Faults in the smart lock should be detected (e.g., via heartbeats).

> These requirements are to be extended so that correct behavior can be verified using the tools of the Software Systems Analysis course.

> The physical prototype can be build around the ESP32 platform with light emitting diodes as stand-ins for an electronically controlled lock. Such a platform will be handed out to > each student following the Software Technology of Internet of Things course.
